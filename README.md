DTO classes are at the bottom of the diagram. These are simple java beans which are used to pass information between layers.
Service in the middle of the diagram. These are used to items to put in the shopping cart

This diagram shows the implementation and factory classes and the supporting classes provided by the web container. Usually a model doesn't need to go into this detail if we know the supporting classes exist.

Use Cases and Robustness Diagrams
We can use draw.io https://www.draw.io/ to draw other UML diagrams such as Use Cases, Robustness diagrams and Sequence diagrams.

Robustness diagrams are an optional 'stereotype' applied to standard UML and not covered in all texts. They are used as part of the ICONIX process.
See [A practical Tutorial on Robustness Analysis] (https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/robustness-analysis-tutorial/)

This gives an answer to the simple use case which has been implemented in class.

Sequence diagrams act as a more standard UML alternative to Robustness Diagrams. This diagam shows two simple usecases
