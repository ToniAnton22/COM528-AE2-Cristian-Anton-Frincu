# shopping Application program template

This is based upon the Shopping Cart Using Spring with Bootstrap in session 6



### To run using stand alone spring boot maven plugin

at base of project do a build
```
mvn clean install
```
move to web module and run project
```
cd web
mvn spring-boot:run
```
the project will be served at http://localhost:8080/index.html

### To run using stand alone cargo maven plugin

Alternatively you can use the cargo plugin
```
mvn cargo:run
```
then navigate to http://localhost:8080/shoppingCartApplication/


### To run the project using  in Netbeans embedded Tomcat server

If you right click on the webfacade-example1 project in netbeans and select 'run' netbeans will spin up a tomcat instance and launch your application.

If you are asked for username and password just use the default admin admin.
 
(You must make sure you have stopped any maven started tomcat before you do this.)

You will be able to see the application at http://localhost:8080/shoppingCartApplication/

Note that sometimes the browser caches the old index.html so you may need to enter the correct url to access the app

http://localhost:8080/shoppingCartApplication/home

not

http://localhost:8080/shoppingCartApplication/home.jsp

robustness diagram

The following Robusteness diagram shows a use case's behaviour, including participant classes and software behaviour. This graphic shows a user buying a item from the catalog, then entering card details to buy the items. Also showing the admin side of things such as modifying the items and the user details.

sequence diagram


Sequence diagrams depict the interactions that must occur in order for a process to be completed. the diagram below shows the roles of each user which includes the user/customer, admin and also shows the importance of the cart.

use case diagram

A use case diagram shows us the interaction between the users/admins and the system by telling us what it's meant to do. The diagram below shows the use case for the user and admin, what there roles are within the application and how it connects together, for example the user can place the order and the admin can then modify.

model diagram

The model diagram shows us the classes and relationships, how its connected to eachother within the system. which is simple version of the code, if you dont understand coding.

Attempts have been made to connect to a database using DbCon.

You will need MySQL version 8.0.26 in order for it to work. Test can be made using "DbConTest" and "UserDao" located in "shopping-cart-dao".
Not enough tests were made to make sure the database is used.
